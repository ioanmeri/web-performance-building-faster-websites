# Web performance explained

## What is Web Performance

or WPO or Front End Performance is an area of web development concerned with making websites faster.

Not only for the initial loading to the browser, but for any user interaction or additional loading they are after.

**Web Performance Optimization**

- Lots of measuring
  - should be continues, as the website grows and develops, loading performance doesn't regress and only get's better
- Improving load times
  - largely done by performance optimization which reduce HTTP response latency
- Perceived performance

  - creating a perception that the website is loading faster that is actually is.

- Make sure images have alt tags
- Get Heather from marketing to sign off copy
- Web performance
- Add Google Analytics

Web performance is about accommodating users, looking after users, improving conversions, search engine optimization and perceived performance.

## Accommodating Users

The Internet is being accessed by users by many different devices types under many different network conditions.

There is the latest, greatest laptop mobile devices

- Dell XPS 13
- Apple iPhone 11 Pro

Budget and legacy devices

- Google Nexus 5
- Nokia 3310 3G
- Assorted Desktops

Devices that web usage is on the rise:

- Apple Watch 5

This means, websites with performance optimizations are going to offer very different user experiences, to those without.

**Example**

iPhone 8 loading CNN on 4G

- 4.5sec for the content to begin rendering
- 13sec until fully loaded

not amazing but it's usable

Moto G4 loading CNN On 3G

- 12.5sec for the content to begin rendering
- 51sec until fully loaded

If websites don't perform as expected, users will abandon the the website and just go elsewhere.

From studies, people believe:

> 50% of websites have remained the same speed or are even slower

> 71% feel that browsing regularly, disrupted by slow websites

> 78% feel negatively towards a slow or unresponsive website

> 44% believe a slow online transaction makes them doubt it was successful

> 42% decided not to use the website again because it was slow

Google discovered:

> Our research has been eye-opening. For 70% of the mobile landing pages we analyzed, it took more than five seconds for the visual content above the fold to display on the screen, and it took more than seven seconds to fully load all visual above and below the fold.

As page load time goes from

> 1s to 3s, the probability of bounce increases 32%

> 1s to 5s, the probability of bounce increases 90%

> 1s to 6s, the probability of bounce increases 106%

> 1s to 10s, the probability of bounce increases 123%

bouncing = leaving immediately

> BBC has seen that they lose an additional 10% of users for every additional second it takes for their site to load

WPO stats

> 53% of visits are abandoned if a mobile site takes longer than 3 seconds to load.
