# Practical Segment

## Getting Started

Download website > Measure > Improve

Re-test under the same conditions

This will also help up to see the overall trend in web performance metrics, as these aren't a fix set of numbers and can sometimes vary widely from report to report.

**Same codebase**

**Same test conditions**

Different results

can be happen due to factors like:

- Current network load
- Number of processes running on a device

### Download files

- `npm install`

- `npm install -g gulp-cli`

- `gulp build`

and serve the website locally with an Apache server (LAMP)

## Prepare Testing Conditions

Upload the files to www directory

Establish:

- Device Type

- Network Speed

- Test Location

- Web Browsers

MLE Power is now a US based business

targeting primarily US based customers

- Moto G4 (2016), 2 years old

- 3G

- Dulles, VA

- Chrome

## Initial Performance Report

**Initial Report**

- Start Render: 5.3s

- FCP: 5.3s

- Speed Index: 8.2s

- Largest Contentful Paint: 18.9s

- Cumulative Layout Shift: 0.231

- Time to Interactive: 35.7s

- Total Blocking Time: 0.6s

- Bytes Downloaded: 4264kb

- Fully Loaded: 33.0s

- Lighthouse score: 12

Goals as Google suggests: mid-range mobile devices on slow 3G aims complete paint with-in 2 to 3 seconds and then have it become interactive under 5 seconds.

**Goals**

- Start Render: 3.0s

- FCP: 3.0s

- Speed Index: 3.0s

- Largest Contentful Paint: 3.0s

- Cumulative Layout Shift: 0.1s

- Time to Interactive: 5.0s

- Total Blocking Time: 0.3.s

- Bytes Downloaded: Max4264kb
